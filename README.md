Github Branching and Merging
1. Create the new branch and switch to it before working on something new: `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>`
2. Develop and create new changes
3. Add the changes: `git add <file_names>` or `git add .`
4. Commit the changes: `git commit -m "<message>"`
5. Push the changes: `git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>`
6. After pushing your changes to your branch, go on the github website and you should be able to create a pull request in the Pull Request tab on the website
7. Ask for a code review, then merge when finished
